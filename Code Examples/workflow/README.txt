Workflow

This is a website designed to showcase use of buttons as well as fetches for data from JSON files.

- Buttons at the top of the table can be pressed for various effects on the table.
- Table headers (ID, Type, Description, Priority, and Assigned) can be pressed to sort the table.
- "Recent Changes" section has data pulled from a JSON file in the same directory.

NOTE: Hyperlinks do not go anywhere.
